# Travis Pages

A node package allows you to automate the process of deploying to github pages by commiting through travis.

Currently in development. I would love to have this tested till this point to see if there are any issues.

## To Test it

* Create a blank git project.
* Link it with repository on github.com [IMP] [Looking to alternative]
* run ```npm install -g travis_pages```
* run ```travis_pages install``` to install required files on your project

### Any bugs reports will be helpful to improve this.

## WIP [ALPHA]
